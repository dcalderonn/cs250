How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To understand what users want for a program, talk to them and figure out their needs. Then, implement their ideas by adding specific features. User stories help because they provide a clear way to write down what users want.

When developing a program, make a plan and break it into smaller tasks. Use agile processes like Scrum or Kanban to work well with others and adapt as needed.
